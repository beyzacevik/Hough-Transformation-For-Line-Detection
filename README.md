## Hough Space Transformation for Line Detection

Hough Space Transformation implemented from scratch in this project without using any framework.

Canny method from 'OpenCV' method for edge detection and .line() method is used for specifying line coordinates on the image.

- canny.py includes Edge Detection method.
- Hough.py includes the methods related to creating the accumulator matrix, finding local maximas and drawing the lines.
- Visualize.py includes operations for reading images and plotting the results. 


**Execution**

python run.py  'path_to_dataset_folder! 'path_to_original' 'path_to_detection'
